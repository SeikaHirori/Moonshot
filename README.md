Part 4: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/42 
- [ ] 1. Add the launch date to MissionView, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.
- [ ] 2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in MissionView is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the Rectangle dividers out too.
- [ ] 3. For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to ContentView that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.
